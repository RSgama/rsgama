# What is RSgama?

> RSgama is a protocol that works at the data link level. Originally, [Charles 
Daniel](https://github.com/chaws) and 
[Rodrigo Siqueira](https://github.com/rodrigosiqueira) were challenged by 
professor Fernando to create a data protocol as a homework  in his class 
(Computer Network). The final result was the modeling and creation of the data 
link protocol, it was implemented many rules for handling many different 
situations. As an overview, look at the state machine of the protocol below:

## What is the the meaning of "RSgama"?

> RS is a reference to RS232, which is the interface that we have used 
originally to create the protocol. Finally, "gama" is a little tribute for 
"Universidade de BrasÃ­lia - **Campus GAMA**".
